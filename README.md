# 🥗 Food Allergy Expert Agent

A sophisticated, production-ready AI agent built with **LangGraph** and **Self-RAG** architecture. This application empowers users to instantly verify food ingredients and allergens through natural language conversation or packaging photo uploads. It combines local structured databases with real-time web search to ensure reliable and comprehensive safety guidance.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatically determines the optimal search path—querying structured SQL databases for brand statistics or vector databases for specific ingredient analysis.
*   **Multimodal Recognition (Vision)**: Seamlessly identifies products and extracts allergen data from uploaded food packaging or ingredient list photos using advanced vision reasoning.
*   **Self-Correction Retrieval (Self-RAG)**:
    *   **Local Knowledge**: Prioritizes verified data from `ChromaDB` and `SQLite`.
    *   **Autonomous Web Search**: Dynamically triggers **Tavily AI** to bridge knowledge gaps when local data is insufficient or outdated.
*   **Dual-Stage Quality Audit**:
    *   **Fact-Check Logic**: Validates generated responses against source documents to eliminate hallucination.
    *   **Utility Assessment**: Ensures every answer directly addresses the user's specific safety concerns.
*   **Real-time Process Transparency**: Displays the step-by-step reasoning chain (routing, retrieval, auditing) for a professional and trustworthy user experience.
*   **Automated Localization**: Instantly translates technical ingredient data from multiple languages (e.g., German, French) into user-preferred language.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Orchestration**: LangChain, LangGraph
*   **Inference Engine**: GPT-4o (Reasoning & Vision)
*   **Databases**: SQLite (Structured), ChromaDB (Vector)
*   **Interface**: Streamlit
*   **Connectivity**: Tavily Search API
*   **Deployment**: Docker, Hugging Face Spaces
